3. **Contemporary Grounding Theory**
   - Kit Fine, Gideon Rosen
   - Grounding as a fundamental metaphysical relation
   - Explains ontological priority
   - Mental supervenes on physical
   - But physical grounds mental
   - Full vs. partial grounding

4. **Essence and Ground in Kit Fine**
   - "Essence and Modality" (1994)
   - Essence is not reducible to necessity
   - Essence provides grounds
   - {Socrates} has Socrates as essential
   - But not necessarily (could not exist)
   - Real definitions vs. modal characterizations

5. **The Problem of Vicious Circularity and Infinite Regress**
   - Some explanations are circular or regressive
   - Are these always vicious?
   - Coherentism allows circles
   - Foundationalism rejects them
   - Well-founded grounding: no infinite descending chains
   - The need for an absolute ground

   - Ousia (essence/being): one
   - Hypostasis (person/subsistence): three
   - Against modalism (Sabellius)

# LXXI-XC: ADVANCED FORMAL SCIENCES (Already completed - see previous document)

---

# XCI-CXX: APPLIED PHILOSOPHY & PERENNIAL PROBLEMS (BRANCHES: 850 SUBJECTS)

## XCI: The Metaphysical Indeterminacy (Vagueness, Sorites, & Borderline Cases) (25 subjects)

**Research Validation**: Vagueness challenges classical logic and metaphysics. From the sorites paradox to supervaluationism, this addresses fundamental questions about reality's structure.

**Warranted Scope**: 25 subjects covers:
- The sorites paradox (10 subjects)
- Theories of vagueness (10 subjects)
- Metaphysical vs. semantic vagueness (5 subjects)

### Examples:

1. **The Sorites Paradox and the Problem of Vagueness**
   - One grain of sand is not a heap
   - Adding one grain never makes a heap
   - Therefore, no amount of grains makes a heap
   - But clearly large collections are heaps
   - Paradox of the heap
   - Bald man paradox: same structure

2. **Borderline Cases and the Limits of Determinate Predication**
   - Is someone with 100 hairs bald?
   - Borderline cases lack determinate truth value
   - Classical bivalence fails
   - Neither true nor false that he is bald
   - Or both true and false?
   - The problem for classical logic

3. **Epistemicism: Timothy Williamson**
   - Vagueness is ignorance
   - There is a precise line, but unknowable
   - Some number of grains makes a heap
   - We just can't know which number
   - Margin for error principles
   - Counterintuitive but preserves classical logic

4. **Supervaluationism**
   - Many ways to precisify vague predicates
   - A sentence is true iff true on all precisifications
   - False iff false on all
   - Neither if true on some, false on others
   - Preserves most classical logic
   - But not bivalence

5. **Degrees of Truth (Fuzzy Logic)**
   - Truth comes in degrees: 0 to 1
   - "x is tall" can be 0.7 true
   - Zadeh's fuzzy set theory
   - Applications in engineering, AI
   - But: what degree of truth does "Truth comes in degrees" have?
   - The sorites for degrees

## XCII: The Epistemic Scepticism (Doubt, Knowledge, & Certainty) (40 subjects)

**Research Validation**: Skepticism has driven epistemology from Pyrrho to Descartes to contemporary contextualism. Understanding skeptical challenges is essential.

**Warranted Scope**: 40 subjects needed for:
- Ancient skepticism (10 subjects)
- Cartesian skepticism (10 subjects)
- Contemporary responses (20 subjects)

### Examples:

1. **The Problem of Epistemic Scepticism and the Justification of Knowledge**
   - Can we know anything?
   - The regress argument
   - Every belief requires justification
   - Justification is itself a belief requiring justification
   - Infinite regress, circularity, or arbitrary stopping point
   - The Agrippan trilemma

2. **The Criterion of Certainty and the Limits of Human Knowledge**
   - Descartes: clear and distinct ideas
   - Locke: agreement with reality
   - Coherence theories
   - Pragmatic theories
   - No criterion commands universal assent
   - The problem of the criterion (Chisholm)

3. **Pyrrhonian Skepticism and the Suspension of Judgment**
   - Sextus Empiricus
   - Equipollence of arguments
   - For every argument, an equal opposing argument
   - Therefore, suspend judgment (epoché)
   - Ataraxia: peace of mind follows
   - Living according to appearances

4. **Academic Skepticism: Arcesilaus and Carneades**
   - Nothing can be known (even this?)
   - Probabilism: some things more likely
   - Carneades's criteria
   - Persuasiveness (πιθανόν)
   - Influence on Cicero
   - Against Stoic claims to knowledge

5. **Descartes's Method of Doubt**
   - Meditations on First Philosophy (1641)
   - Doubt everything that can be doubted
   - Senses deceive (illusions, dreams)
   - Evil demon hypothesis
   - Even mathematics might be false
   - The cogito as indubitable

6. **The Brain in a Vat (Putnam)**
   - You might be a brain in a vat
   - Fed experiences by computer
   - Everything you believe might be false
   - Putnam's response: semantic externalism
   - "Brain" and "vat" refer to real brains and vats
   - So the statement is self-refuting

7. **Contextualism in Epistemology**
   - David Lewis, Keith DeRose
   - "Knows" is context-sensitive
   - In ordinary contexts, I know I have hands
   - In skeptical contexts, I don't
   - Standards shift with context
   - Resolution of skepticism?

8. **Moore's "Proof of an External World"**
   - "Here is one hand" (holds up hand)
   - "Here is another" (holds up other hand)
   - Therefore, at least two external objects exist
   - Q.E.D.
   - Is this question-begging?
   - Or appropriately basic?

## CLXXIII: The Metaphysics of Time (50 subjects)

**Research Validation**: [Already partially covered in II.C, but this provides comprehensive philosophical treatment separate from physics]
