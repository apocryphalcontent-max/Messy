### **CXCIV: The Metaphysics of Gender, Sex, and Sexual Difference (90 subjects)**

**Research Validation:** The existing "Metaphysics of Sex, Gender, & Personhood" (CII) is too narrow. Sexual difference is central to: Genesis anthropology, Trinitarian theology (Bulgakov), feminist theology, philosophy of body, marriage theology.

**Warranted Subjects:**
- "The Metaphysical Foundations of Sexual Difference in Genesis 1-2"
- "Bulgakov's Sophiology and the Divine Feminine"
- "Edith Stein's Phenomenology of Woman and Complementarity"
- "John Paul II's Theology of the Body and Sexual Meaning"
- "The Androgyne Myth and Eschatological Gender (Maximus, Berdyaev)"

### **CXCV: The Metaphysics of Memory & Anamnesis (70 subjects)**

**Research Validation:** Memory is foundational but scattered across consciousness (III.C), liturgy (XLVI), and identity (V.A). Deserves systematic treatment: Augustinian inner time, liturgical anamnesis, Proustian involuntary memory, collective memory (Halbwachs).

**Warranted Subjects:**
- "Augustine's Phenomenology of Memory in the Confessions"
- "The Liturgical Anamnesis: Making the Past Present"
- "Plato's Anamnesis: Recollection as Knowledge of Forms"
- "Husserl's Retention and the Constitution of Temporal Objects Through Memory"
- "The Eucharistic Memory and the Real Presence of the Past"

### **CXCVI: The Metaphysics of Music, Sound, and Harmonic Order (65 subjects)**

**Research Validation:** Music as metaphysical reality is absent. Yet: Pythagoras's harmony of spheres, Boethius's musica mundana, liturgical music as cosmology, Schopenhauer's music as Will, Orthodox theology of voice. Major gap.

**Warranted Subjects:**
- "The Pythagorean Harmony of the Spheres and Cosmic Proportion"
- "Boethius's Three Types of Music: Mundana, Humana, Instrumentalis"
- "Schopenhauer's Metaphysics of Music as the Will Itself"
- "The Theology of the Voice in Orthodox Hymnography"
- "The Liturgical Soundscape: Music as Participation in Heavenly Worship"
