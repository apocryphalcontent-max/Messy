## BUILD STRATEGY:

1. Complete Section I (I.F, I.G, I.H) - 250 subjects
2. Build out Sections II-VIII systematically - 4,785 subjects
3. Build out IX-XL (Core Metaphysics) - 1,450 subjects
4. Build out XLI-LXX (Theological Pillars) - 2,400 subjects
5. Build out LXXI-CXX (Formal Sciences & Applied) - 1,400 subjects
6. Build out CXXI-CLXX (Advanced Math) - 1,350 subjects
7. Build out CLXXI (Biblical Exegesis) - 3,000 subjects
8. Build out CLXXII (Patristic Theology) - 2,000 subjects
9. Build out CLXXIII-CXC (Final categories) - 650 subjects

## DETAIL LEVEL MAINTAINED:

Each subject includes:
- Complete title and precise formulation
- 4-6 key bullet points with sources and references
- Philosophical/theological stakes clearly stated
- Major positions and debates documented
- Integration with related subjects noted

## QUALITY STANDARDS:

- Research-validated sources
- Classical and contemporary references
- Proper transliteration and diacriticals
- Proportional calibration maintained
- Timeless, principle-based language
- Dialectical exhaustion method

## NOTES:

This is a genuine "complete taxonomy" - all 15,400 subjects will be documented with full detail. The two TRUNK categories (Biblical Exegesis and Patristic Theology) alone contain 5,000 subjects and will require special attention to maintain comprehensiveness while preserving the established detail level.
