- God knows what free creatures would do in any circumstance
- Enables providence without determinism

- Conclusion: □E (God exists necessarily)
- Objection: modal collapse - everything necessary?

**17. Plantinga's Victorious Modal Ontological Argument**
- The Nature of Necessity (1974)
- Maximal greatness: excellence in all possible worlds
- A being has maximal greatness if it has maximal excellence in every world
- Maximal excellence: omniscience, omnipotence, moral perfection
- Premise: Maximal greatness is possibly exemplified
- If possible, then necessary (by definition)
- Therefore, God exists

**18. Gödel's Modal Ontological Proof**
- Discovered posthumously (1970)
- Positive properties: excellences
- Axioms: being positive is a positive property
- God = having all positive properties
- Necessary existence is a positive property
- Therefore God exists necessarily
- Sobel, Anderson, Oppy: modal collapse problem

**19. The Modal Collapse Objection**
- If God necessarily exists and necessarily knows everything
- And God knows p is true
- Then p is necessarily true
- Therefore everything is necessary
- No contingency
- Responses: restrict the logic, deny premise

**20. Essence and Modality: Kit Fine's Argument**
- "Essence and Modality" (Analysis, 1994)
- Essence is not reducible to necessity
- {Socrates} has Socrates essentially
- But {Socrates} doesn't have Socrates necessarily (could not exist)
- Essence is definitional priority, not just necessity

- Distinguishes essential from accidental properties
- Implications for transhumanism
- Persistence through time

**23. Counterpart Theory: David Lewis**
- Modal claims about individuals
- "Humphrey could have won the election"
- True iff Humphrey's counterpart wins in some world
- Counterpart relation: similarity, not identity
- Avoids trans-world identity problems
- But: "Humphrey cares whether he wins, not his counterpart" (Kripke)

**24. Trans-World Identity vs. Counterpart Theory**
- Can the same individual exist in multiple worlds?
- Kripke: yes (stipulation)
- Lewis: no (counterpart relation)
- The problem of identification across worlds
- Haecceitism vs. anti-haecceitism

- Quine was wrong to be skeptical
